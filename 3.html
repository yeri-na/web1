<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[8] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming
  language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[9] JavaScript is
   high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has
   -bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and
   first-class functions.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World
 Wide Web.[10] Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,[1]
  often incorporating third-party libraries.[12] All major web browsers have a
   dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.

As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional,
 and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces
 APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data
 structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
